# Real_Estate_DataScience

Our project name is REAL ESTATE. While working on this project our main focus was to analyze the round sum rate for the property by judging, using the data we gathered. We took the required data from Kaggle platform. The main factors we took in consideration were total square feet area, site location, balcony area, bathroom, etc.
 
Python libraries like NumPy, pandas function, etc. were used on data while working on this project. One Hot Encoding is used for the representation of categorial variables into a format that can be readily used by machine learning algorithms. After that we find the accuracy of the model.

For comparing we used GridSearchCV. It is a technique for finding optimal parameter values from given set of parameters in a grid. The model as well as the parameters must be entered. After extracting the best parameter values, predictions are made. Then Linear Regression analysis is used to predict the value, then Decision tree model to compare the two and get the best accurate predicted price. Linear regression turns out to be the preferred model for analysis as it gives the most accurate predicted value for the property.
